This script is a better version of the earlier Nmap Automation Script, with user interaction menu, allowing you to perform
scans which you prefer.

Options it has(for now):
1) Ping Scan
2) Aggresive Scan(with version enum)
3) All Ports
4) All Of the Above in a single step


This script will be usefull for CTF players who play KoTH,boot2root etc, where typing long nmap commands and 
saving the output is quite tedious and time consuming task.

As a solution to that problem I have created this script for automating the scans and saving the output, which can save
quite some time and take you closer to your flag ;) 

Please feel free to modify and make the script better, or give me suggestions to make it better.
